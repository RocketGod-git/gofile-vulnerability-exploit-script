# Gofile Vulnerability Exploit Script üï∑Ô∏è

This script demonstrates a critical flaw in the way the Gofile website handles and stores its files. The main objective of this script is to increase awareness and emphasize the importance of secure file handling practices for developers and website administrators. I learned about this flaw in discussions with @SkeletonMan03

## üåê Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. Generates a random 6-character alphanumeric string.
2. Uses the Gofile API to check the validity of a constructed Gofile URL.
3. If a valid URL is found, it sends a notification to a predefined Discord webhook.

## üîß Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RocketGod-git/gofile-vulnerability-exploit-script
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory and open `main.py` in your preferred text editor.
   ```bash
   cd gofile-vulnerability-exploit-script
   nano main.py
   ```
   Or if Windows, use your favorite text editor to edit main.py.
4. Locate the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` constant and replace `"YOUR-DISCORD-WEBHOOK-GOES-HERE"` with your own Discord webhook URL.
   ```python
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR-DISCORD-WEBHOOK-GOES-HERE"
   ```
5. Save and close the file.
6. Install the required libraries:

   pip install requests
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script using:
